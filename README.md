# traefik-acme
traefik only for acme certs generation

Reason: 

- You have multiple hosts and want to run multiple traefik-http-only instances as ingress
- https offloading is done by an external loadbalancer in front of the stack (certs from acme.json are extracted to that loadbalancer)
- Because certbot & co would cause double work on managing host lists and creating certs, why not use the labels on containers already available to generate acme certs with a single traefik instance, which only purpose is to generate certs and nothing else

This example is meant to be run on Docker Swarm.

### run the stack

```
docker swarm init

echo "mydomain.com" > .env

bash run.sh
```
